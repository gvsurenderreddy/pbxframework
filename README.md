# pbxframework
Ringfree PBX Framework

This is a branched fork from upstream's 13.0 release.  This branch is modified to be deployed on Ringfree PBX templates and upgraded from the previous framework branch currently in use as of Jan 2016.  It is modified to have client's not pull from upstream's Github resources directly but pulled from this branch and packaged using the original tgz format.

This branch is currently in development.
